# Pocket Drums: A Real-Time Audio Synthesizer

**Developer:** Miles Berman
**Date:** March 18, 2024

## Introduction

This is a simple, real-time audio sequencer developed in JavaScript, designed to run directly in web browsers. It enables users to create simple drum patterns with the combination of kicks, snares, hi-hats, and toms, and can also accept sample audio files.
## Implementation

The synth was developed to meet specific criteria for CMPM 150:

- **Playback** Generates audible signals directly within the browser.
- **Responds to Input:** Offers controls to start, stop, and modify sound parameters in real time.
- **Non-Trivial:** Features at least 3 operators for sound generation (kicks, snares, hi-hats, and tom), surpassing the complexity of generating a single sine wave tone.

### Synthesis Technique
