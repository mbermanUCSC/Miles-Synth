## Introduction

Miles Synth is a versatile, real-time audio synthesizer developed in JavaScript, designed to run directly in web browsers. It enables users to create dynamic soundscapes through interactive controls, making it an ideal tool for video games, interactive art, and educational purposes. This synthesizer is capable of generating a wide range of sounds, from simple sine waves to complex audio signals, by manipulating various parameters in real time.

## Implementation

Miles Synth was developed to meet specific criteria, ensuring functionality, responsiveness, stability, and complexity:

- **Can Run:** Generates audible signals directly within the browser.
- **Responds to Input:** Offers controls to start, stop, and modify sound parameters in real time.
- **Stable:** Designed to prevent numeric overflows and maintain consistent performance.
- **Non-Trivial:** Features at least 3 operators for sound generation, surpassing the complexity of generating a single sine wave tone.

### Synthesis Technique

Miles Synth utilizes [describe the synthesis technique, e.g., subtractive, FM, additive, etc.], allowing for a diverse range of sounds. The core of the synthesis is based on [briefly describe the mathematical foundation or formulas used, if applicable].
